# House Rental Management

## Project Overview
The **House Rental Management** project is an online platform designed to streamline the rental process by connecting three main user groups: landlords, students, and administrators. As student housing demand rises in major urban areas, this system addresses the unique needs of each group to simplify property management and accommodation search.

## System Overview
- **For Students:** Helps students quickly search for and register rental rooms that meet their specific needs using filters based on location, price, size, and amenities.
- **For Landlords:** Enables homeowners to post, manage, and update rental listings with detailed property information. It also allows them to respond to student comments via an integrated email notification system.
- **For Administrators:** Provides tools to oversee the entire process, including approving or rejecting rental listings, managing user accounts, and ensuring smooth system operation.

## Project Goals
- **Efficient Housing Search:** Assist students in finding suitable rental accommodations quickly.
- **Enhanced Transparency:** Increase transparency in rental transactions.
- **Cost and Time Savings:** Reduce the time and costs associated with the housing search process.
- **Improved Management:** Enable landlords to effectively manage and monitor their property listings.

## Scope
Designed for high-demand areas such as university neighborhoods and urban centers, the platform offers:
- Advanced search filters for accommodation.
- Online rental contract management.
- A rating and review system to assess property quality.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (main), Redis (for caching notifications and session management)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Conclusion
The House Rental Management project bridges the gap between students seeking housing and landlords managing rental properties. It delivers a comprehensive, efficient, and transparent platform that meets the practical needs of its users and provides a strong foundation for future enhancements.
